The function assures that the last point is exactly the same as the first one. When not specified, the user can define the polygon by a series of clicks on the previously displayed image. The result is a list containing the polygon and a ``satin'' object with  the same dimensions as the original, but where the pixels outside the aoi are set to NA.\n}\n\\value{\nA list with two components:\n \\item{polygon}{polygon coordinates defining the aoi}\n \\item{aoi}{a ``satin'' object as returned by \\code{\\link{read.oceancolor}}}\n\n}\n%\\references{\n%% ~put references to the literature/web site here ~\n%}\n\\author{\n HÃ©ctor Villalobos\n}\n%\\note{\n%%  ~~further notes~~\n%}\n\n%% ~Make other sections like Warning with \\section{Warning }{....} ~\n\n\\seealso{\n \\code{\\link{read.oceancolor}}, \\code{\\link{getpoly}} \n}\n\\examples{\n# load and display sample data\ndata(dbsst)\nplotSatin(dbsst)\n  \n# define polygon, cut the image and display the aoi\npolyg <- data.frame(x = c(-125, -126, -120, -119, -125), y = c(35, 30, 28, 34, 35))\ndbsst.cut <- cutSatin(dbsst, polygon = polyg)\nplotSatin(dbsst.cut)\n\n\\dontrun{ \n\n# the same, but polygon is defined by clicking on the image\nplotSatin(dbsst)\ndbsst.cut <- cutSatin(dbsst, return.poly = TRUE) # *** draw the aoi polygon ***\ndbsst.cut$polygon # show polygon coordinates\nplotSatin(dbsst.cut$aoi) # plot the selected aoi\n}\n}\n% Add one or more standard keywords, see file 'KEYWORDS' in the\n% R documentation directory.\n%\\keyword{ ~kwd1 }\n%\\keyword{ ~kwd2 }% __ONLY ONE__ keyword per line\n",

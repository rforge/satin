Depends: R (>= 3.0), h5r, ncdf, maptools, maps, PBSmapping, chron, plotrix, splancs
Description: Main functions extract a user defined subset of satellite data 
             from hdf5 files which are then available for further analyses and
             can also be displayed in maps. Currently supported NOAA products 
             includes: Quick Scatterometer (QuikSCAT); Moderate-resolution Imaging 
             Spectroradiometer (from Aqua satellite: Aqua MODIS) and Sea-viewing 
             Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS). The functions have been tested 
             with sea surface temperature (SST), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration 
             from Aqua MODIS and SeaWiFS and ocean surface wind speed data 
             from QuikSCAT.

\title{ Obtaining isolines from satellite data }
\description{
  User defined isolines are calculated from satellite data and returned as polylines
}
\usage{
isolineSatin(satin.obj, levels, image = 1, plot = TRUE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{satin.obj}{ a satin object as returned by \code{read.oceancolor} }
  \item{levels}{ vector of desired isolines }
  \item{image}{ number of image to process }
  \item{plot}{ logical, if \code{TRUE} a plot is produced (the default) }
}
\details{
  Polyline coordinates of desired isolines are calculated via \code{contourLines} and \code{convCP} (from \pkg{PBSMapping} package). Perhaps only interesting with sea surface temperatures (isotherms).
}
\value{
  a data frame object of class "PolySet". See \code{help(PolySet)} for a complete description
}
